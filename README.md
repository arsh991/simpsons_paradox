## Introduction
This repository is dedicated to supporting the research presented in the paper **Resolution of Simpson's paradox via the common cause principle**. 

## Contents

Inside the repository, you'll find the pseudocode of the numerical search algorithm which was used for generation of numerical examples of a tertiary cause. The numerical examples are represented in the *examples.nb* *Mathematica* notebook. These examples are designed to show the instances of causes that support aggregation, no aggregation and neither of them. You need to download the *examples.nb* file to view the examples in a desktop *Mathematica* application or via *Wolfram Cloud*. The file is tested with *Mathematica 9.0* but it should run seamlessly with other versions too.
